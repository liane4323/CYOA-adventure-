CONGRATS! You help them get out. They thank you and the both of you find some resources, which was very lucky since the person you saved had some prepared while attempting to leave their house. They got crushed by some pieces of rubble that caught onto them while they got out. They're eternally grateful to you. The rescue team comes in after some time and you get saved by the rescue team.
